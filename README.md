## Guide

Take a look at this blog post that can guide you through the idea and the setup: [Easily add canonical URLs to your Rails app](http://blog.planetargon.com/entries/2014/4/4/easily-add-canonical-urls-to-your-rails-app)

## Challenge

I've seen a lot of folks do more harm by neglecting canonicalization altogether than by applying too narrowly and conservatively, so here is an attempt to let people start modestly without spending too much time on it and whitelist parameters as they need to.

## Install

    gem 'canonical-rails', github: 'jumph4x/canonical-rails'

## Usage

First, generate the config

    rails g canonical_rails:install

Then find it in config/initializers/ as canonical_rails.rb

Finally, include the canonical_tag helper inside the `head` portion of
your HTML views:
```ruby
  <%= canonical_tag -%>
```

## Collection actions configuration update (updated 24.07.2017)

You can now specify collection actions for specific controller#action pairs, like this

```ruby
  config.collection_actions = [[:tags, :show]]
```
